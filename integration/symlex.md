# Symlex Framework
The [Symlex framework](https://github.com/symlex/symlex) use RoadRunner as default application server.

**Symlex aims to simplify agile Web development by providing a working system that promotes best practices by example:**
  - Built on top of well documented and tested standard components
  - Contains everything to create full-featured Web applications: Service container, REST routing & Twig template engine
  - Strict use of dependency injection for configuration and bootstrapping
  - Small code and memory footprint
  - Extremely fast compared to other PHP frameworks, especially in combination with [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)
